        <p>Azir is a mage-empowered champion in League of Legends known for his powerful control over sand soldiers and his ability to summon turrets. He hails from Shurima, an ancient and mysterious empire, and seeks to restore his fallen civilization to its former glory.</p>
        <p>As the emperor of Shurima, Azir was betrayed and killed by those closest to him. However, he was resurrected by the magic of the ancient Shuriman ruins, returning as a powerful ascended being with control over sand magic.</p>
        <p>Azir's ultimate goal is to rebuild the empire of Shurima and reclaim its former glory, uniting the scattered remnants of his people and leading them to a new era of prosperity and power.</p>
