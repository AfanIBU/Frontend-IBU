        <p>Azir summons a Sand Soldier at a target location, which attacks nearby enemies. His basic attacks are replaced with a dash that deals magic damage to enemies hit.</p>
        
        <h2>Conquering Sands</h2>
        <p>Azir sends all Sand Soldiers toward a target location, dealing magic damage to enemies they pass through and slowing them.</p>
        
        <h2>Arise!</h2>

        <h2>Shifting Sands</h2>
        <p>Azir dashes to one of his Sand Soldiers, dealing magic damage to enemies he passes through and knocking them up briefly. If Azir hits an enemy champion, he stops and gains a shield.</p>
